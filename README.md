# 🖼️ Image Feature Extraction & Prediction

This project is a Streamlit web app that extracts features from uploaded images using Img2Vec and makes predictions with a pre-trained ML model (loaded via pickle).

# 🚀 Features

Upload an image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg).

Extract vector embeddings using Img2Vec
.

Use a pre-trained machine learning model (model.p) to make predictions.

Interactive Streamlit-based UI.
